                <p class="leftP">Taiwanese people tend to have small "communities," so it's highly likely that you
                will be surrounded by many other Taiwanese adults and children the host is close with. You may feel
                left out from time to time, but don't panic. Give it some time, listen to their conversation, and you'll fit in no problem.</p>

                <p class="rightP" style="width: 620px;">Unlike most American families, Taiwanese families have various plates of food and
                everyone shares the food with own tableware. If you're uncomfortable with that, you may want to politely address your problem and ask to
                get some food on your plate first</p>

            <p class="leftP">Chopsticks. Gotta know how to use them chopsticks.</p>

            <p class="rightP">Regardless of your belief, it is best not to talk to talk about your opinion on politics between
            Taiwan and China. It can be a very sensitive (and sometimes offensive) topic</p>

            <p class="leftP">Taiwanese families are very friendly and enthusiastic, but remember to stay polite. It's a biggie.</p>
