            <p class="leftP">Birthday party isn't really a party. It's an occation where friends gather together, eat and have fun together. So don't wear too sexy or too formal clothes -- these are for 
            dance parties. </p>

            <p class="rightP">One taboo question: "How much was that/this present?" Japanese are really careful not to talk about money related topics, because it might offend someone or might sound like you are showing off by accident.</p>
