                <p class="leftP" style="width: 490px;">In the Chinese culture, if someone is making the introductions, to introduce your self is considered disrespectful. So when it is your turn to be introduced, stand up, smile and look at the people also being introduced with ease. After being introduced, you can shake hands with each other and give mutual greetings</p>
